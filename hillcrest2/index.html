    <h3>Let us Introduce Ourselves!</h3>
    <p> As a family-owned, local Little Rock based bakery, we are proud to be a part of Central Arkansas.
         We want our branding to be instantly recognizable to our customers and our Hillcrest community.
        </p>
    <p>The purpose of this style guide is to be a reference document used by our employees to ensure that our written communications are consistent within our brand.
         This guide has specific detail regarding our brand voice, logo system, typography, and texture.
        </p>
    <p>
        As our business expands into nationwide delivery and additional locations, brand recognition becomes even more important. Our goal is to have strong,
         uniform messaging to our customers that is synonymous with our flavorful, made from scratch menu.

      </header>
        <p>We want you to feel at home when you walk through our door. With a mix of homemade recipes and ideas from years of traveling around the U.S., we’ve created a menu that we can’t wait to share with Little Rock.
          Our priority is creating flavorful food with quality ingredients. From our freshly brewed coffee to our made from scratch cheesecakes, you definitely will taste the difference.</p>
