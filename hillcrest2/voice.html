      <h2>What is Brand Voice?</h2>
      <p>Brand voice refers to our personality and the tone we want to convey when we write or speak about our bakery to our customers.
          We want to make sure that we connect with our audience in a way that leaves a lasting impression.
          Our brand mainly focuses on our website and social media presence, but donâ€™t let that fool you!
          We love communicating with our customers in person too!</p>
      <p>At <strong>Hillcrest Little Bakery</strong> (HLB), we want to connect with our audience in a friendly manner.
          Just like we want you to feel at home when you walk through our doors, we want to write (and speak) in a welcoming way. </p>
      <p>This includes:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Use of exclamation points!</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Example: Yes! We will be open 7am-2pm!</li>
          </ul>
          <li>No negative words, we like to keep things light. (Like our biscuits!)</li>
          <li>We like our pleases and thank yous. Just like we enjoy hearing it from our customers, 
              we like to express that we are grateful for all the support that we receive.
          </li>
          <ul>
              <li>Example: Thank you for the support in this crazy time.</li>
              <li>Example: Please stop by for a yummy lunch! We are open, support your locals.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>To break it down, we want our voice to be easy going, as if we are having a conversation over a bite to eat.
          We want our brand to be welcoming, enthusiastic, and amiable. Everyone is part of a community at Hillcrest Little Bakery!
