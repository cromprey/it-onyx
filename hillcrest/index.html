                <h2>Let us introduce ourselves!</h2>
                <p>As a family-owned, local Little Rock based bakery, we are proud to be a part of Central Arkansas. We want our branding to be instantly recognizable to our customers and our Hillcrest community.</p>
                <p>The purpose of this style guide is to be a reference document used by our employees to ensure that our written communications are consistent within our brand. This guide has specific detail regarding our brand voice, logo system, typography, and texture.</p>
                <p>As our business expands into nationwide delivery and additional locations, brand recognition becomes even more important. Our goal is to have strong, uniform messaging to our customers that is synonymous with our flavorful, made from scratch menu.</p>
